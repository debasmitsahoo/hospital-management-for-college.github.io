# Hospital Management System (HMS)

A modern, responsive, and interactive Hospital Management System web application built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. No external frameworks or backends are used.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Doctor Management**: Manage doctor profiles and specializations.
*   **Medical Records**: Create and view medical history linked to patients and doctors.
*   **Data Persistence**: All data is stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage), so it survives page refreshes.
